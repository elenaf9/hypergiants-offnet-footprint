# Measuring the AS footprint of hypergiants' off-nets

**Research Question:**  
What is the AS footprint of hypergiants' off-nets today?  
*We limit this research question to only target the hypergiant Meta / Facebook.*

**Methodology:**  
*Inspired by [Gigis et al.].*
1. [./bgp-mapping](./bgp-mapping/): Aggregate the IPv4 addresses announced by the hypergiants AS  
2. [./onnet_scan](./onnet_scan/): Perform an on-net scan on the aggregated IPv4 space to collect all TLS certificates from this hypergiants  
    - use zgrab2 to perform https handshake with each online host
    - collect unique TLS certificates and unique HTTP headers
3. [./offnet_scan](./offnet_scan/): Perform off-net scan on the whole IPv4 address space
    - scan with zmap for hosts online on port 443
    - scan with zgrab2 for meta related certificates and headers

## Results

Unique TLS Certificates: 15  
Off-net host count: 16172  
Off-net AS count: 2339
